## Reverting the Project and Installations

To completely remove the project and its dependencies from your system, follow these steps:

1. **Remove the project directory**:
   ```sh
   rm -rf /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Uninstall Ruby gems**:
   If you have installed any Ruby gems specifically for this project, you can uninstall them using:
   ```sh
   gem uninstall <gem_name>
   ```

3. **Remove system dependencies**:
   If you have installed any system dependencies, you may need to remove them manually. For example, on a Debian-based system:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get remove --purge <package_name>
   ```

4. **Clean up configuration files**:
   Remove any configuration files that were created for this project. These might be located in your home directory or other system directories.

5. **Drop the database**:
   If you have created a database for this project, you can drop it using your database management tool. For example, with PostgreSQL:
   ```sh
   dropdb <database_name>
   ```

6. **Remove environment variables**:
   If you have set any environment variables for this project, you can unset them in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).
